My Reads Project: A book Repository for myself

About My Reads:

This is my first project for the React section of the Front End Web Developement NanoDegree Program. The main page has 3 shelves: Currently Reading, Want to Read, & Read. The books are able to be moved between the shelves as your status changes with them, example.. once you finish a book in your Currently Reading shelf you can move it to the Read shelf and so on. You can also select new books to add to your shelves by hitting the search button. When you navigate back to the main page, the book you selected will show up on the appropiate shelf. You can also remove a book by selecting the none option when choosing the shelf.

How to launch:

1. cd into react-project-myreads-starter
2. run npm start
